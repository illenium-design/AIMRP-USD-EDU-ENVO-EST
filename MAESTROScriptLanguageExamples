[[[[ The RetrieveOrderDetails step retrieves order details from the OrderSystem. The ProcessPayment step utilizes the PaymentGateway component to process a payment. The endpoint https://payment.api/process is where the payment processing logic is expected to be handled. Again, keep in mind that this is a simplified and fictional example. In a real-world scenario, you would replace placeholders with actual logic and integrate with a real payment gateway API. ]]]]
