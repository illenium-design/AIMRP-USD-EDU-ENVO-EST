To use a personal URL for the Qiskit library instead of the public one, you'll need to host the Qiskit library file (main.js) on a server accessible by your application. Here are the general steps:

1. **Host the Qiskit Library:**
   - Upload the `main.js` file to a web server, a cloud storage service (like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or GitHub), or your personal website.
   - Ensure that the file is publicly accessible.

2. **Replace the URL:**
   - Replace the existing URL with the URL where you hosted the `main.js` file. If you're using a cloud storage service, it might provide you with a public URL for the file.

For example, if you hosted the file on your personal website and it's accessible at `https://example.com/qiskit/main.js`, you would replace the URL in your HTML file like this:

```html
<!-- Replace this URL with your personal URL -->
<script src="https://example.com/qiskit/main.js"></script>
```

3. **Test:**
   - After making the changes, test your HTML file to ensure that it correctly loads the Qiskit library from your personal URL.

Keep in mind that if you're hosting the Qiskit library on a server or platform that you control, you'll need to manage updates and versioning yourself. Using a content delivery network (CDN) or the official Qiskit CDN is often recommended for stability and convenience.

Note: Make sure that you comply with the licensing terms of the Qiskit library and any other applicable licenses when hosting and distributing it.
