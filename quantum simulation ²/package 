In the context of software development, a "package" typically refers to a collection of related code, resources, and configuration files bundled together for easy distribution and use. The components of a software package can vary depending on the programming language, framework, or package manager being used. Here are common components found in a software package:

1. **Source Code:**
   - The primary logic and functionality of the software.
   - Written in a programming language such as Python, JavaScript, Java, etc.

2. **Documentation:**
   - Instructions, guides, or manuals explaining how to use the software.
   - May include API documentation, installation guides, and usage examples.

3. **Configuration Files:**
   - Files specifying settings, parameters, or options for the software.
   - Examples include YAML, JSON, or INI files.

4. **Dependencies:**
   - A list of other software libraries or packages required for the package to function.
   - Often specified in a configuration file like `requirements.txt` (Python) or `package.json` (JavaScript).

5. **Build Scripts:**
   - Instructions or scripts for compiling, transpiling, or bundling the source code.
   - Common build tools include Make, Gradle, Maven, npm, etc.

6. **Test Cases:**
   - Code and scripts for automated testing to ensure the software's correctness.
   - Often included in a separate directory, such as `tests` or `spec`.

7. **License:**
   - Information about the software's licensing terms and conditions.
   - Usually includes a text file named `LICENSE` or `LICENSE.md`.

8. **Version Information:**
   - Metadata indicating the version of the software package.
   - Often stored in a file like `version.txt` or specified in the build configuration.

9. **Executable Binaries or Scripts:**
   - Compiled or interpreted versions of the code for direct execution.
   - Can include standalone binaries or scripts for interpreted languages.

10. **Resource Files:**
    - Non-code assets required by the software, such as images, templates, or configuration files.
    - These files are often organized in specific directories (e.g., `assets` or `resources`).

11. **Contributing Guidelines:**
    - Guidelines for developers on how to contribute to the project.
    - May include a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file or similar.

12. **Changelog:**
    - A file or document detailing the changes made in each version of the software.
    - Typically named `CHANGELOG.md` or similar.

13. **Package Metadata:**
    - Information about the package, including its name, description, author, and other metadata.
    - Stored in a file like `package.json` (JavaScript), `setup.py` (Python), or similar.

The specific components and file structures can vary based on the development environment and best practices of the programming language or framework being used. Package managers like npm, pip, Maven, or others may have additional conventions for organizing and distributing software packages.
