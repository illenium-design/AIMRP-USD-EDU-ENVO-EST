To find out audience metrics for a website or application, you typically integrate analytics tools or services that provide insights into user behavior. One of the most commonly used tools for this purpose is Google Analytics. Below are steps to get audience metrics using Google Analytics:

### Google Analytics Setup:

1. **Create a Google Analytics Account:**
   - Go to the [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/) website and sign in with your Google account.
   - Follow the prompts to create a new Google Analytics account.

2. **Set Up a Property:**
   - After creating an account, set up a property (website or app) within that account.
   - Follow the instructions to add a new property, providing details about your website or app.

3. **Get Tracking Code:**
   - Once your property is set up, you'll receive a unique tracking code.
   - This code needs to be added to every page of your website or app to collect data.

### Add Tracking Code to Your Website:

1. **Include the Tracking Code:**
   - Copy the tracking code provided by Google Analytics.
   - Paste this code into the `<head>` section of every page you want to track, just before the closing `</head>` tag.

   ```html
   <!-- Google Analytics Tracking Code -->
   <script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=YOUR_ANALYTICS_ID"></script>
   <script>
     window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
     function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
     gtag('js', new Date());
     gtag('config', 'YOUR_ANALYTICS_ID');
   </script>
   ```

   Replace `YOUR_ANALYTICS_ID` with the actual Analytics ID provided by Google Analytics.

2. **Verify Implementation:**
   - After adding the tracking code, verify the implementation using the Google Analytics interface. It may take some time for data to appear.

### View Audience Metrics:

1. **Login to Google Analytics:**
   - Go to [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/).
   - Sign in with your Google account.

2. **Select Property and View:**
   - Choose the relevant property and view (website or app) from the dropdown menus.

3. **Access Audience Reports:**
   - In the left sidebar, navigate to "Audience" and explore various reports, such as "Overview," "Demographics," "Interests," and more.

4. **Customize Reports:**
   - Customize reports based on your specific requirements to gather insights about your audience.

By following these steps, you can integrate Google Analytics into your website and access audience metrics to better understand user behavior, demographics, and other relevant insights. Keep in mind that other analytics tools may have similar processes for implementation and accessing audience metrics.
